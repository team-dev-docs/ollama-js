# Ollama-js Project Structure

The Ollama-js project is a JavaScript library for interacting with Ollama, a platform for running large language models. This document outlines the overall structure of the project, including its main directories and key configuration files.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main directories:

```
ollama-js/
├── src/
├── examples/
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### src/ Directory

The `src/` directory contains the core source code of the Ollama-js library. Key files in this directory include:

- `browser.ts`: Implements the `Ollama` class for browser environments, providing methods to interact with the Ollama API.
- `index.ts`: The main entry point of the library, extending the browser implementation with Node.js-specific functionality.

These files define the primary interfaces and methods for generating responses, chatting, creating models, and other API interactions.

### examples/ Directory

The `examples/` directory contains sample code demonstrating how to use the Ollama-js library:

- `multimodal/multimodal.ts`: Shows how to use the library for multimodal interactions, such as describing images.
- `tools/calculator.ts`: Demonstrates the use of function calling and tool integration with Ollama models.

These examples serve as practical guides for developers looking to integrate Ollama-js into their projects.

## Key Configuration Files

### package.json

The `package.json` file is crucial for defining the project's metadata and dependencies. Key aspects include:

- **Project Information**: Name, version, description, and license.
- **Entry Points**: Defines main, module, and types for different import scenarios.
- **Scripts**: Commands for testing, building, and linting the project.
- **Dependencies**: Lists required packages, including development dependencies.

### tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler options for the project:

- Sets strict type-checking options.
- Configures module resolution and output settings.
- Specifies the target ECMAScript version and included libraries.
- Defines input and output directories for compilation.

This configuration ensures type safety and proper compilation of TypeScript code to JavaScript.

## Conclusion

The Ollama-js project is structured to provide a clear separation between core library code (`src/`), usage examples (`examples/`), and project configuration. This organization facilitates easy development, testing, and integration of the Ollama-js library into various JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
