# High Level Context
## context
This file (src/index.ts) defines the main Ollama class, which extends OllamaBrowser and implements additional functionality for interacting with the Ollama API. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for processing image inputs
2. Modelfile parsing and manipulation
3. File handling and path resolution
4. Blob creation and management for model files
5. Model creation with support for both streaming and non-streaming responses

The file also exports all types from the interfaces file and creates a default instance of the Ollama class. This serves as the main entry point for the Ollama TypeScript SDK, providing a comprehensive set of tools for working with language models and the Ollama API.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama appears to be a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It provides additional functionality for working with Ollama, which is likely an AI model or framework. Here's a concise explanation of what Ollama does in this code:

1. It provides methods for encoding images to base64 format.
2. It can parse and modify modelfiles, replacing certain commands with blob hashes.
3. It handles file path resolution and checks for file existence.
4. It creates blobs from files, computing SHA256 digests and uploading them if necessary.
5. It overrides the `create` method from the parent class, adding functionality to handle modelfile content from either a file path or direct input.

Overall, this class seems to be a wrapper or extension that adds convenience methods and file handling capabilities to the base OllamaBrowser implementation, specifically for working with models and their associated files in the Ollama ecosystem.
