# High Level Context
## context
This file (src/index.ts) defines the main Ollama class, which extends OllamaBrowser and implements additional functionality for interacting with the Ollama API. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for processing image inputs
2. Modelfile parsing and manipulation
3. File handling and path resolution
4. Blob creation and management for model files
5. Model creation with support for both streaming and non-streaming responses

The file also exports all types from the interfaces file and creates a default instance of the Ollama class. This serves as the main entry point for the Ollama TypeScript SDK, providing a comprehensive set of tools for working with language models and the Ollama API.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama appears to be a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It provides additional functionality and methods for working with Ollama, which is likely an AI model or system. Here's a concise explanation of what Ollama does based on the provided code:

1. It handles image encoding, converting images to base64 format.
2. It parses and modifies modelfiles, replacing certain commands with blob hashes.
3. It resolves file paths and checks for file existence.
4. It creates blobs from files, computing SHA256 digests and uploading them if necessary.
5. It provides a create method for creating models, which can handle both streaming and non-streaming responses.

Overall, Ollama seems to be a wrapper or extension that adds functionality to the base OllamaBrowser class, particularly for handling model creation, file processing, and blob management in the context of an AI system or model.

# OllamaDrama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
Based on the code snippet provided, here's a concise explanation of OllamaDrama:

OllamaDrama is a custom class that extends another class called OllamaBrowserThing. It defines a single asynchronous method named coolYeah, which takes an image parameter but currently doesn't use it. The method always returns the string "hello" regardless of the input.

Without more context or additional code, it's difficult to determine the full purpose or functionality of this class. The name suggests it might be related to some kind of drama or action involving Ollama (possibly an AI or language model), but the implementation shown is very basic and doesn't provide much insight into its intended use.
