# High Level Context
## context
This file (src/index.ts) is the main entry point for an Ollama client library, likely for interacting with an AI language model. It extends a browser-based Ollama class and adds additional functionality for working with local files and modelfiles. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for handling different image input types
2. Modelfile parsing and processing, including replacing FROM and ADAPTER commands with blob hashes
3. File path resolution and existence checking
4. Blob creation and management for file uploads
5. Model creation functionality with support for both streaming and non-streaming responses

The class provides methods for working with local files, creating blobs, and interacting with an API endpoint. It also handles different environments (browser vs. Node.js) and provides type exports for easier usage in other parts of the application.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama is a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It appears to be a wrapper or extension of the OllamaBrowser class, providing additional functionality for working with AI models and files. Here's a concise explanation of what Ollama does:

1. It handles image encoding, converting images to base64 format.
2. It parses and modifies modelfiles, replacing certain commands with blob hashes.
3. It resolves file paths and checks for file existence.
4. It creates blobs from files, computing SHA256 digests and uploading them if necessary.
5. It provides a method to create models, either from a file path or modelfile content.

Overall, Ollama seems to be a utility class for managing AI models, handling file operations, and interacting with a model-related API.
